		<h2>Avocado Mango Smoothie</h2>
		<p>You can feel really good about starting your day or ending your workout with this recipe since this smoothie is packed with nutrition. Avocados have plenty of healthy fats, potassium, fiber, and vitamins C and B6. Mangos have double the daily value of vitamin C and are high in fiber, vitamin B6, and potassium as well. If you would like to keep the sugar level low, use an orange juice with less sugar or make your own.</p>
