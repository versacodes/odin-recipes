		<h2>Creamy Chicken Soup</h2>
		<p>This creamy chicken and mushroom soup is easy to make. The mix of vegetables and thyme adds richness, while the bone-in chicken flavors the broth. If you're in a hurry, you can skip the chicken breasts and add rotisserie chicken at the end instead.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 ½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 2 split breasts)</li>
			<li>24 ounces fresh mixed mushrooms, sliced</li>
			<li>1 ½ cups chopped yellow onion</li>
			<li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
			<li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>3 cups whole milk</li>
			<li>2 cups unsalted chicken broth</li>
			<li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cook chicken, skin-side down, in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat until the skin is golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 6 minutes.</li>
			<li>Transfer the chicken to a plate; remove and discard the skin.</li>
			<li>Add mushrooms and onion to the drippings in the pot; cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and the onion is softened, about 7 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add carrots, garlic and thyme; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Add flour; cook, stirring constantly, until toasted, about 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Add milk, broth and salt; stir to combine. Nestle the chicken into the mixture.</li>
			<li>Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to maintain a simmer.</li>
			<li>Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of the chicken registers 165 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes. (Do not remove from heat.)</li>
			<li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board; let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Shred the meat into bite-size pieces; discard bones.</li>
			<li>Stir the shredded chicken and peas into the soup then serve hot.</li>
		</ol>
